This was a kata I did at Fanzoo Technologies' "Learn Something" event on Feb 26, 2015. The event was only 3 hours long, so this was a quick-and-dirty project. Otherwise it would have comments and more tests.

The goal of the kata was to create a program that could take an arbitrary number and render it as ASCII text in a 'digital LCD alarm clock style'. The program also needed to be able to scale the numbers up and down in size, using more or fewer characters for the digital line segments as desired.
